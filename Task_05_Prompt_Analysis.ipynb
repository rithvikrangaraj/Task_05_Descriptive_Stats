    "# LLM Prompts ‚Äì Basic Factual Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q1: How many teams played in the 2024 college basketball season?\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Answer: 362 teams\n",
    "- ‚úÖ LLM Response Accuracy: Correct\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2: Which team had the highest Adjusted Offensive Efficiency (ADJOE)?\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Answer: Connecticut (UConn) ‚Äì ADJOE: 127.1\n",
    "- ‚úÖ LLM Response Accuracy: Correct\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3: Who had the best defense based on Adjusted Defensive Efficiency (ADJDE)?\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Answer: Houston ‚Äì ADJDE: 85.5\n",
    "- ‚úÖ LLM Response Accuracy: Correct\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4: Which team had the most wins?\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Answer: Connecticut ‚Äì Wins: 31\n",
    "- ‚úÖ LLM Response Accuracy: Correct\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5: Which team had the highest BARTHAG (Power Rating)?\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Answer: Houston ‚Äì BARTHAG: 0.9785\n",
    "- ‚úÖ LLM Response Accuracy: Correct\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q6: Which teams had high offense but weak defense?\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Answer: Wright State and High Point\n",
    "- ‚úÖ LLM Accuracy: Confirm if logic parses ADJOE + ADJDE thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q7: Which conference had the most high-performing teams?\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Answer: Big 12 (6 teams in top 20 BARTHAG)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ LLM Accuracy: Check if LLM can group by CONF and rank frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q8: Does faster tempo (ADJ_T) lead to more wins?\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Answer: No strong correlation (r = ‚Äì0.015)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ LLM Accuracy: Should describe correlation or lack thereof\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q9: Which team had the lowest Turnover Percentage (TOR)?\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Answer: Princeton ‚Äì TOR = 12.0%\n",
    "- ‚úÖ LLM Accuracy: Should scan for column minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q10: Among Sweet 16 teams, who had the best 3-point shooting?\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Answer: Arizona ‚Äì 3P_O = 37.1%\n",
    "- ‚úÖ LLM Accuracy: Should filter POSTSEASON == S16, then rank by 3P_O\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q11: Which teams had high offensive efficiency but weak defense?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ü§ñ LLM Response:  \n",
    "  \"There are no teams in the 2024 dataset that exhibit both high offensive efficiency and weak defense.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚ùå Accuracy: **Incorrect (False Negative)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- üß† Validation:  \n",
    "  We defined thresholds:\n",
    "  - ADJOE in **top 15%** (‚â• 115.2)\n",
    "  - ADJDE in **bottom 30%** (‚â• 109.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Using this:\n",
    "  - **Wright State** (ADJOE: 115.2, ADJDE: 113.5)\n",
    "  - **High Point** (ADJOE: 114.1, ADJDE: 109.5)  \n",
    "  both meet the criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Correct Answer:  \n",
    "  Two teams qualify: **Wright State** and **High Point**. These teams are offensively strong but defensively poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- üìé Commentary:  \n",
    "  The LLM failed to correctly apply compound filters, likely due to misunderstanding percentile logic or applying strict instead of inclusive thresholds.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ## Q12: Which teams overachieved based on their WAB?\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Answer: Vermont (28 wins, WAB ‚Äì1.2), App State, Colgate, etc.\n",
    "- ‚úÖ LLM Accuracy: Should compare WAB vs actual wins and flag large negative WAB\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q13: Should a coach focus on offense or defense to improve win totals?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ü§ñ LLM Response:  \n",
    "  \"Based on the dataset, Adjusted Defensive Efficiency (ADJDE) has a stronger influence on wins, so coaches should prioritize improving their defense.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚ùå Accuracy: **Incorrect**\n",
    "\n",
    "- üß† Validation:  \n",
    "  We computed Pearson correlations:\n",
    "  - ADJOE vs Wins: **+0.717**\n",
    "  - ADJDE vs Wins: **‚Äì0.670**\n",
    "\n",
    "  While both metrics are important, the **stronger positive correlation is with offense (ADJOE)**. The LLM likely misunderstood that **lower ADJDE is better**, and misinterpreted the sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Correct Answer:  \n",
    "  Coaches should focus on improving **offensive efficiency (ADJOE)** if they aim to increase win totals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- üìé Commentary:  \n",
    "  This highlights how LLMs may struggle with **inverse metrics** (where lower is better) and misinterpret correlation direction. Careful validation is essential."
